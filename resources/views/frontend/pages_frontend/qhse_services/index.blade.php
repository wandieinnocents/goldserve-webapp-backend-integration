                                            <!-- Getting an expatriate worker on board always involves an investment in training, physical relocation of the worker and of course the cost of the worker. They are always expected to start work immediately and be productive. This is where the orientation comes in. It is the process of making the expatriate worker feel at home, prepared for the new location of work, and of course ready to get started on the job.</p> -->
